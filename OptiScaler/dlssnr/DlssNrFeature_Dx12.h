// DLSS 5 Neural Rendering, run over the upscaler's output.
//
// Neural Rendering is a post-process, not an upscaler and not a denoiser: it takes a finished frame plus
// depth and motion vectors and synthesises detail. NVIDIA ships no public integration for it, so it is
// driven directly through nvngx_dlssnr.dll as feature 18.
//
// OptiScaler is the right host for it because of one thing it knows that an external hook cannot: which
// NGX evaluate belongs to the upscaler and which to frame generation. Both are handed depth and motion
// vectors, so anything guessing from the parameter block alone attaches to both and runs the model twice
// per rendered frame. Here it is a lookup on the feature handle.
class Config;

// The model runs immediately after the game's upscaler, before the interface is drawn. It is shown a
// display-referred proxy of that frame -- the sort of picture it was trained on -- and its answer is
// composed back over the untouched original.
// Runs the model over Output on the same command list, immediately after the upscaler has written it.
// Called only for upscaler evaluates -- never for frame generation, which is the whole point.
//
// Safe to call every frame; it builds what it needs on first use and disables itself for the session if
// anything fails, rather than retrying into a crash.
// timingQueue is the queue this command list will be executed on, when the caller knows it.
// State::currentCommandQueue only exists once a D3D12 swapchain has been created, which a Vulkan
// game never does -- so without this the pass runs and never reports what it cost.

//
// Everything the pass needs is already in this parameter block at this point -- depth, motion vectors,
// the create flags, the subrect dimensions -- and the only thing that changes is which texture is the
// frame: Colour rather than Output. Colour is at the game's render resolution, so the model is built at
// that size and costs the square of the render scale: at DLSS Performance, a quarter of what the same
// pass costs after the upscaler.
//
// What it trades away is that the detail is synthesised at render resolution and the upscaler then
// enlarges it. Which side of that trade is better is not settled, so both entry points exist and
// [DlssNr] Placement picks one. Exactly one runs per frame -- running both would show the model its
